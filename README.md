# Python_100days100projects
 
Hi there !
Being consistent is one of the most essential factors of becoming a good programmar. 
Small small steps count to form a huge impact.
This is what I have tried in this #100daysofcode challenge. I will be devoting atleast an hour a day for practising python and small project everyday.
This is an Udemy course of Dr. Angela Yu named '100 Days of Code: the Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022'
Hoping to do bigger things in future.
